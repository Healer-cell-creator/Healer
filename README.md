Hello, if you're reading this, you probably either saw my video, which i won't link here, OR, you are just curious for a h@ck!ng tool avaible for DISCORD.

Right now, i'm developing one, with different options! It's always trying to improve.
Also one thing i wanna mention is that, you can, YES! use this as a "template" for your own, just give credits when doing so.

I wanna add that the token grabber is still in [TEST] and probably will always be unfortunately. It's too hard to get one in my opinion and isn't worth my time.
